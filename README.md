# Shopify Critical CSS

A Shopify app that speeds up your store for first time customers. 

If you're on Shopify, you're probably a small business. And if you're a small (hopefully growing) businesses, bets are most of your customers will be new. That means the first interaction they have with your store will be the most important one. Unlike other speed optimisation apps, this one focuses on that first experience for a customer.

## How does it work?

For the layman, the app works by only including the styles that will be needed for the first screen straight away, and downloading the rest in the background. This means the first interaction a user has with your website will be much faster. They have some time to look at that first screen, before deciding to scroll down, click to another page, etc. We use this crucial time to load and apply the rest of the styles in the background. This is called critical css.
